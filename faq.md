## Can you help me prepare my article for publication?
English Editor can provide the professional editing needed to improve your work and get it ready for publication. Our expert editors will eliminate typos, ensure grammatical correctness, and smooth out the writing so that it is clear and expressive. We will make the required revisions to ensure consistency throughout the document, and we will apply the style guide of your choice, including specific journal guidelines, to your citations and references. Our editors will also provide critical commentary, pointing out where issues remain, where arguments are flawed or incomplete, and where improvements can be made.
You’ve done the hard work, and you don’t want your work to be rejected because it lacked a final polish. Have English Editor shine up your work for submission. 

## I need help with making sure this conforms to a specific style guide (APA 6th Edition, MLA, Turabian, Chicago Manual of Style, etc.).
No problem. Just tell us what style guide we should refer to when you place your order, and our editor will ensure that the style guidelines are applied consistently throughout your document. The style guidelines are typically applied to the citations and references. If you want them applied to other elements, such as the headings, figures, and structure, please make sure to let the editor know that you want these elements revised when you place your order. Visit our Academic or Student page for a complete list of available services.

## What style guides do you work with?
We can apply any style guide to your work. The most popular style guides are the American Psychological Association (APA), Modern Language Association (MLA), Turabian, Chicago Manual of Style, Harvard Referencing, and Council of Science Editors (CSE). We can also apply a journal’s style guide (just send us the details) or a corporate/internal style guide.

## I’m submitting to a specific academic journal. Can you apply this journal’s style guidelines to my article?
Yes, we can certainly apply your target journal’s style guidelines to your article. Please provide us with the name of the target journal when you place your order. If possible, please provide a link to the specific style guidelines: simply copy the URL for the journal’s guidelines and paste it into your client notes when you place your order. 

## What if I'm not satisfied with the work that was done?
English Editor takes customer satisfaction very seriously. You can provide feedback directly to us (there will be a link on your order details page), or you can get in touch with us using the English Editor Contact Us page or by calling us and we will look into your issue immediately.
